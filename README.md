The site is deployed here: https://english2bds.onrender.com/

Main functionality: Translates accidental english text to Bulgarian.
Currently works with English to Bulgarian typewriter and phonetic.

Examples: \
"Riud; jfld od e kd ur,r.r[d" -> BDS/Typewriter -> "Искам това да е на кирилица" \
"Iskam towa da e na kirilica" -> Phonetic -> "Искам това да е на кирилица"
---------------------
It depends what Bulgarian layout you were using before accidently to switch to English \
